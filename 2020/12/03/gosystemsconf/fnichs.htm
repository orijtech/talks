<li>Intelligently sift through indefinite search spaces of possibilities (reduce entropy)</li>
<li>Based off real world experiences that have been validated</li>

        <h3>Fundamentals</h3>
        <ul>
<li>Just like every system is built by cells: the smallest indivisible unit, we start from fundamentals and build upwards</li>
<li>Technology is meant to return time into our hands and make us productive</li>
<li>As more features and business cases are developed, complexity compounds</li>
<li>Standing on the shoulders of giants!</li>
<li>Risk increases as complexity increases</li>
<li>When a system fails, cascading failures of other systems follow too:
<ul>
<li>Compounded complexity</li>
<li>Lack of redundancy</li>
<li>Dependencies</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

        <h3>n-process system</h3>
        <ul>
<li>In a simplistic model, with 2 process system, if each spoke to the other,
we'd have:
<ul>
<li>A-&gt;B, and B-&gt;A RPCs</li>
<li>2 * 1 = 2 unique RPC connections</li>
<li>4 * 3 = 12 unique RPC connections</li>
<li>100 microservices, talking to each other: 100*99 = 9900 RPCs</li>
<li>40K microservices: 40K*39,999 = 1.6B RPCs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If we have n services:
<ul>
<li>n * (n - 1) ~= n² unique RPC connections</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Realistic systems with authentication, database can have 9+ services:
<ul>
<li>login, identity, quota, caching, database, metadata, storage, pubsub, recommendations etc</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Even the most talented engineers hit walls when debugging complex interactions</li>
<li>High entropy and chaos always reign, and our world is largely still undiscovered</li>
<li>Even the most respected engineering titans still use call centre like ticket handling and struggle to debug, despite
unlimited budgets, sophistication, many bodies</li>
<li>Cascading failures, wild goose chases</li>

        <h3>Case study: Dgraph 2018</h3>
        <ul>
<li>Dgraph problems with Raft; failures identified by Jepsen
<ul>
<li>Their team had spent months trying to figure out what was wrong, but in vain :-(</li>
<li>July 2018, Manish Jain attends my talk, <a href="https://orijtech.github.io/talks/2018/07/18/gosf/gosf.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Planet scale observability with OpenCensus"</a></li>
<li>Dgraph's team is very highly skilled at building distributed systems, but without observability they hit blind edges</li>
<li>Exchanged contacts, I shared my slides; had video chats about problems at Dgraph with Raft and Jepsen test failures</li>
<li>Kept in touch, would answer questions, got them to adopt the OpenCensus Agent that I had written; the agent helped scale their observability</li>
<li>Manish added OpenCensus, and in hours figured out what was tripping out and had caused many months of headache</li>
<li>Spent Thanksgiving 2018 with the Dgraph team at their office in San Francisco, adding observability to their code</li>

<li>Barrage of cascading errors happening very fast: world on fire!
<ul>
<li>5K QPS * 10 instances * ~300B/span ~&gt; 172.8GiB/day ~&gt; 1.181TiB/week</li>
<li>How about 40K QPS??</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Health of the system at any point <strong>unknown</strong></li>
<li>Security issues? Network saturation? Resource exhaustion? Seasonalities?</li>
<li>Debugging requires walking through non-recreatable conditions</li>
<li>Lost time not executing on your business model nor improving company culture</li>
<li>Chaos erupts within site reliability engineering (SRE) divisions</li>
<li>Lost reputations, negative press, pressure on your employees and share holders</li>
<li>Inability to apply fundamentals further compounds more problems</li>
<li>Cascading failures, unresponsiveness</li>

        <h3>Observability</h3>
        <ul>
<li>Inferring the states of a system by examining signals.</li>
<li>In Linear Algebra, a system is represented as a form of equations with variables expressing states
<ul>
<li>If there is a solution to the equation, it is linearly solvable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The industry currently uses traces, metrics, logs for signals to examine states</li>
<li>Take a look at OpenCensus, OpenTelemetry</li>
<li>Don't just list out and tick off the observability signals, get a great APM provider</li>
<li>Use instrumented libraries, and integrations</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Running integration tests with Google Cloud Storage would probabilistically fail</li>
<li>Same code that had been running for ages started to fail</li>
<li>Can't blame cosmic rays for this</li>
<li>Hit up a new friend on the storage team, Frank Natividad, walked over to the building at MP3 Sunnyvale after lunch</li>
<li>Firstly, ran isolated integration tests in a loop, counted how often they failed</li>
<li>Enabled observability, and that we were transmitting trace-context headers</li>
<li>Followed trace-context headers, and discovered odd failures that seemed implausible</li>
<li>Used <strong>GODEBUG=http2debug=2 go run main.go</strong> which revealed that it failed with <code>"contentType":null</code></li>
<li>Embarassing bug, but we filled it: code freeze and reliability engineering happy</li>

        <h3>High and fast bursts of telemetry/events</h3>
        <ul>
<li>Data produced fast and in huge quantities</li>
<li>Can't be analyzed in a timely fashion nor retrieved easily</li>
<li>Can't store every trace produced lest blow out of storage budgets
<ul>
<li>5K QPS producing say 8 spans, each span about 300B ~&gt; 17.28GiB/day</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sifting through those events when disaster strikes
<ul>
<li>Very expensive</li>
<li>Requires continual monitoring</li>
<li>Requires robust tools</li>
<li>Requires lots of quality information, less noise, less goose chases</li>

        <h3>Sampling and isolating outliers/anomalies</h3>
        <ul>
<li>How can we surface the most important information, report anomalies?</li>
<li>Most sampling for traces today is done in programs by blind, coin-toss sampling
<ul>
<li>Probability, head based sampling is common</li>
<li>Rate limit based sampling used too</li>
<li>Tail based sampling tried too</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unfortunately, blind head based and rate limit sampling blindly ignores important events, lose critical information</li>
<li>If for a short burst of time e.g. when PS5 sales kick off, your e-commerce service gets overwhelmed with traffic,
coin toss sampling, even rate limited sampled might generate too many events that a very highly skilled but falliable
and fatigued human has to sift through</li>
<li>Can we do better?</li>

        <h3>Central Limit Theorem (CLT)</h3>
        <ul>
<li>Statistical theorem modeling randomized events over time; falling into a normal distribution</li>
<li>Proven first &amp; independently by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarl_Waldemar_Lindeberg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><strong>Jarl W Lindeberg</strong></em></a> in 1922, but unknown to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><strong>Alan Turing,</strong></em></a> who in 1935, proved it for BSc. thesis &amp; it earned him a Fellowship to King's College, Cambridge</li>
<li>Alan showed intellectual prowess by proving this theorem</li>
<li>If you ever got graded on the "Bell Curve", or got ranked, think of the CLT</li>
<li>CLT's proof unlocked keys to major advancements and assumptions in our modern world</li>
<li>Other distributions can be approximated by a normal distribution:
<ul>
<li>Caveat: might need extra techniques: ask a professional statistician/data-scientist</li>
</ul>

        <h3>3 sigma rule</h3>
        <ul>
<li>By consequence of the CLT, if randomized events behave as a normal distribution:
<ul>
<li>Detect anomalies by using confidence intervals and variance: 3-sigma rule</li>
<li>99.7% of values in the normal distribution aren't anomalous</li>
<li>Any quantifiable value <em><strong>&gt;= µ+3σ</strong></em> or <em><strong>&lt;= µ-3σ</strong></em> is considered an anomaly</li>

        <h3>Case study: Go runtime regression on Darwin: 2019</h3>
        <ul>
<li>runtime: threading regression on Go1.11, Go1.12:
<ul>
<li>Issue <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/32326" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#32326</a> reported by Michael T Jones, running on an 18 core machine</li>
<li>Chatted with Ian Lance Taylor and Michael T Jones about potential problems</li>
<li>Spun up diagnostic to get data in zips with runtime traces as per <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/32326#issuecomment-524997226" target="_blank" rel="noopener">execute, gather and zip code</a>, zip shared offline directly by Michael</li>
<li>Right after arriving home from a long haul international flight, sat down modelled the system</li>
<li>Examined runtime traces, read the runtime scheduler code, inferred linear behavior</li>
<li>Bissected code to a commit that turned out to be a regression from an Assembly instruction that incorrectly blocked every system call and started a new thread on Darwin</li>
<li>Validated <a href="https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/197938/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coincidental fix</a> by Minux Ma; models matched serious regression</li>
</ul>

        <h3>Continuous Profiling</h3>
        <ul>
<li>A computer's Central Processing Unit (CPU) runs at mostly specific frequencies e.g. 2.5Ghz, 3.6Ghz</li>
<li>Ghz (GigaHertz) where a Hertz is the unit of frequency: cycles per second</li>
<li>2.5Ghz (2.5 billion cycles per second)</li>
<li>Profiling within programs performs sampling after being sent a SIGPROF signal, and stopped 100 times a second</li>
<li>100 pauses/sec vs 2.5 billion cycles/sec</li>
<li>Helps isolate where your code is spending most of its cost, over time: CPU, RAM, Network</li>
<li>Profiling will show you where most of your code is taxed, and if you fix those hotspots, by Amdahl's Law, you'll end up making your programs faster</li>
<li>Profiling can reveal surprising information that can't be caught during code reviews</li>
</ul>
